                        Mini Cryptex consists of 6 levels of increasing difficulty. You will receive successive questions upon solving and entering the answer of each level and/or completing the task involved.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The winner will be the first person to complete all levels. In case that no one is able to complete Cryptex before the 1800 hours 27th July, the person who occupies the first position on the leaderboard will be declared winner.

                        The competition is open only to freshers.

                        The questions, answers or any discussion related to them must not be posted anywhere. Doing so will result in disqualification. We will provide a platform to communicate with the moderators and ask for hints.

                        If a question involves typing answers in an answer box, the answers should be typed completely in lowercase, without any spaces, punctuation, special characters or numerals. The only exception to this is when the answer is the numeral greater than 1000 or when the answer is a special character.

                        Google is your friend. Usually. You’re expected to use Google and other online tools in your quest to crack Cryptex. Do keep in mind that Google may give you erroneous results in certain cases.

                        Reverse searching images might help you in certain cases.

                        The questions are open-ended, may have red herrings, cheeky hints and may lead you on wild goose chases. If you are getting nowhere with a certain approach, do consider that you might be on the wrong train of thought.

                        On the other hand, it could be that the answer is ‘colour’ when you have been trying ‘color’. Check for alternate spelling, names and other such variations.

                        Clues might be hidden (especially in the first few questions) to reduce wrong trains of attack. Their absence, however, does not indicate anything.

                        Hints to the questions will be released on the forum based on certain factors. The hints and even the titles of the question may not have any apparent meaning until you figure of the answer and/or receive another part of the clue.

                        The forum is the quickest way to reach the moderators of Cryptex. You may ask for hints on the forum.

                        The questions might involve simple cryptography, wordplay, steganography, conventional puzzles or maybe simple connect questions. However each of them is designed to be solved in a reasonable amount of time with access to just internet and pen and paper.
